    "## Changing the Swift GRB binning\n",
    "There are some cases in which we need to use different data resolutions and binning; handling these situations can be solved in this package by managing the _resolution_ $res$ argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through **ClassiPyGRB**, you can change the _resolution_ variable to $2$, $8$, $16$, $64$, and $256$ ms respectively. Additionally, you can set $res=1000$ for 1s binning and $res=10000$ to use data with a signal-to-noise ratio higher than 5 or 10 s binning (10s data don't have uniform time spacing).\n",
    "\n",
    "In **ClassiPyGRB** you have a high-level of saving data customization. You can set the following paths:\n",
    "- $root\\_path$ (str): Main path to save data/results from SWIFT. Unique mandatory path to ensure the functionality of SWIFT Class.\n",
    "- $data\\_path$ (str, optional): Path to save data from SWIFT. Defaults to Data folder inside root\\_path.\n",
    "- $original\\_data\\_path$ (str, optional): Path to save non-manipulated data from SWIFT. Defaults to Original\\_Data folder inside data\\_path.\n",
    "- $noise\\_data\\_path$ (str, optional): Path to save noise-reduced data from SWIFT. Defaults to Noise\\_Filtered\\_Data folder inside data\\_path.\n",
    "- $results\\_path$ (str, optional): Path to save non-manipulated data from SWIFT. Defaults to Results folder inside root\\_path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, in **ClassiPyGRB** you can customize the bands used from Swift/BAT data using the parameter `n_bands`. This parameter consists of an array of integers ranging from 1 to 5, where each integer represents a unique band from Swift. In order, 1 represents the 15-25 keV band, 2 represents the 25-50 keV band, 3 represents the 50-100 keV band, 4 represents the 100-350 keV band, and 5 represents the 15-350 keV band. Therefore, for example, by using $n\\_bands=[2, 4]$ **ClassiPyGRB** understands that you would like to work with 25-50 keV and 100-350 keV bands. Setting `n_bands` appropriately can help you to improve time of preprocess, results of t-SNE and custom plotting from Swift/BAT.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the most simple and easy implementation of **ClassiPyGRB** only uses $root\\_path$ as a main folder and saves both data and results in this path:\n"
